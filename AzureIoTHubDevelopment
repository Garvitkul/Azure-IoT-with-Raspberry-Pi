Azure IoT Hub is a collection of managed services that can connect, monitor, and control IoT devices. It also includes secure communication for devices, with data visualization and analytics that help the device manufacturers to build, deploy, and manage IoT applications with the help of Azure cloud. Azure IoT Hubâ€™s Device-to-Cd telemetry data lets us know about the state of the connected IoT devices, and the Cloud-to-Device messages enable us to send commands and notifications to the connected devices. An example could be like, using a smart home automation system, we can collect various sensor data and send them to Azure IoT Hub to visualize, store and manage them. We can also control the output devices from the Azure IoT Hub interface.

Central hub for bi-directional communication for IoT application and devices supports both device-cloud and cloud-device communication, it also supports multiple messaging patterns such as a device to cloud telemetry, file upload from devices, and request-reply methods and finally, we can use the per-device authentication method that enables each device to connect securely to the IoT Hub.
