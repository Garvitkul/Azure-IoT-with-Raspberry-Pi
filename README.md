# FutureReadyTalentInternship
A project submitted for the Future Ready Talent Internship of Microsoft.


Microsoft's Azure IoT Hub cloud computing solution allows developers to connect, monitor, and manage billions of Internet of Things devices on a single platform. It's already in use in a variety of IoT applications, including home automation, security, surveillance, and monitoring. We'll build a tiny circuit with the Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 Temperature, and Humidity Sensor, and use it to process sensor data to demonstrate the potential of Azure IoT hub. Finally, we'll use the MQTT protocol to send sensor data to the Azure IoT server. In this article, we'll learn how to use a Raspberry Pi to set up and install an Azure server and deliver data.

 **Components**
 Raspberry Pi 3B (We can also use any other models of Pi)
 Micro SD Card-16 GB
 DHT11 Sensor
 Micro USB 5V, 2.4A Power supply

**Required Libraries of python**
azure-iot-device
azure-iot-hub
azure-iothub-service-client
azure-iothub-device-client
